 The program will go through the array to determine if two numbers from the given array
 can be added together to get a certain target sum
 The program will first try to add the first element to the last one
 If the two numbers != targetSum because the sum is higher than the target sum,
 the program will add the first number to the number preceeding the final one
 If again that number is higher, it will take add the first number to the one preceeding the other number
 If the number is lower than the sum, the counter is reset and the number following the first one is added
 to the final number. If that one is less than the sum, the number following the smaller number is added to the final one
This goes on until all elements are parsed
